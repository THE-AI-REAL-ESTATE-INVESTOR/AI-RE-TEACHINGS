VISUAL EXPLANATION
- AI model trained on data up to October 2023.
- Knowledge cutoff at October 2023 affects outputs.
- Outputs based on pre-October 2023 data only.
- Limitations include lack of post-2023 awareness.
- No predictions or knowledge beyond October 2023.
- Training data is source of all model outputs.
- Model cannot update or learn post-2023 events.
- Outputs are static relative to training period.
- Model inherently limited by its knowledge cutoff.
- Training data informs predictions within time boundary.
