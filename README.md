### **1. Welcome & What You’ll Learn (2 mins)**  
- **What Is Fabric?**  
  Fabric is a **command-line tool** designed to interact with AI models like OpenAI or local models in a **simple, powerful, and text-centric way**.

  Fabric **reduces friction** when using AI by letting you run tasks like summarizing content, analyzing text, or generating ideas—all from your terminal.  
- **Who Created It?**  
  Fabric was created by **Daniel Misler** to help humans **work smarter** with AI.  
- **This Lesson's Goal**:

### **2. Why the Command Line? (2 mins)**  
- Many people are unfamiliar with the terminal, but here’s why you should give it a shot:  
   1. **Speed**: Fabric is **much faster** than switching tabs to a web browser.  
   2. **Customization**: You can modify AI prompts using **Patterns** to suit your needs.  
   3. **Automation**: Build workflows to save repetitive tasks.

---

### **3. Installing Fabric (3 mins)**  

#### **Step 1: Install**  
- go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
  
- make sure you have go installed - https://go.dev/dl/
  

#### **Step 2: Set Your API Key**  
- If you’re using OpenAI, create an API key from [OpenAI’s platform](https://platform.openai.com).  
- Store it in Fabric using this command:  
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```  

#### **Step 3: Verify Fabric**  
Run:  
```bash
fabric --help
```  
You’ll see a list of Fabric’s options and patterns.

---

### **4. What Are Patterns? (5 mins)**  
- **Patterns** are reusable prompt templates designed to get high-quality responses from AI.  
- Think of them as **recipes** for solving common problems—ready to use with one command.

---

### **5. Running Your First Pattern (5 mins)**  

Let’s try a few real examples using Fabric’s Patterns:

#### **Example 1: Summarize Text**  
Use the `create_summary` pattern to summarize any input text.  
```bash
fabric -p=create_summary -v="#text:This is a long paragraph of content that I want to summarize quickly."
```  
**What’s Happening**:  
- `-p=create_summary`: Selects the pattern.  
- `-v="#text:[Your Content]"`: Passes the text to the AI for summarization.  

**Output**:  
You’ll get a concise summary, saving you time when reading long documents.

---

#### **Example 2: Extract Wisdom from Content**  
Use the `extract_wisdom` pattern to pull insights from an article or video transcript.  
```bash
fabric -p=extract_wisdom -v="#text:AI will revolutionize every industry, and those who adopt it early will lead the market."
```  
**Why It’s Useful**: This is perfect for skimming content, articles, or YouTube transcripts to find the **key takeaways**.  

---

#### **Example 3: Analyze a Sales Call**  
If you’ve transcribed a call, analyze it for feedback.  
```bash
fabric -p=analyze_sales_call -v="#text:This is the transcript of a sales call where I pitched my product."
```  
**What Happens**:  
Fabric will highlight strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

---

#### **Example 4: Clean Up Text**  
Remove redundant formatting, bad spacing, or messy text with `clean_text`.  
```bash
fabric -p=clean_text -v="#text:This  is    messy  text  that needs   cleanup!"
```  
**Why It’s Useful**: Quickly clean data before using it elsewhere.

---

### **6. Pattern Simplified: How to Read & Customize Patterns (5 mins)**  

Fabric Patterns are easy to break down. Let’s look at a simplified template:

```yaml
# Example pattern for summarizing text
name: create_summary
description: Summarize input text into a concise format.
variables:
  - name: "#text"
    description: "The input text to summarize."
```

**How It Works**:  
- `name`: Pattern name (e.g., `create_summary`).  
- `description`: Explains what the pattern does.  
- `variables`: Inputs (e.g., `#text`) passed to the AI.  

**Creating Your Custom Pattern**:  
Save this structure to a new `.yaml` file, modify it, and Fabric will recognize it.

---

### **7. Integrating Fabric With Your Workflow (5 mins)**  
Once you’re comfortable, here are advanced tips to integrate Fabric into your daily tasks:  

1. **Automate Note-Taking**: Export AI outputs into apps like Obsidian:  
   ```bash
   fabric -p=create_summary -v="#text:Long content here" > notes.md
   ```  

2. **Filter Content**: Use Fabric to decide what to read or ignore:  
   ```bash
   fabric -p=extract_insights -v="#text:Interesting article about AI trends."
   ```  

3. **Record Ideas Instantly**: Use Fabric to capture rough ideas and turn them into blog posts:  
   ```bash
   fabric -p=create_micro_summary -v="#text:Your idea or draft content."
   ```
